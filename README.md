My name is Nima Gurung and I am a rising junior at Academy for Software Engineering! I will start working at MSK as a cybersecurity technician with one of my fellow classmates. This role offers challenging and dynamic work while allowing the workers to gain problem solving and analytical skills. I will learn new technologies, threats, and challenges that are emerging regularly in this field and more.
